","body":"# Welcome\r\n\r\nThis repository is a cheatsheet for Markdown, including GFM or \"Github Flavored Markdown\" as Github calls it, containing syntax and examples. \r\n\r\nMarkdown is originally by John Gruber, and you should read his [original specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is ubiquitous at the time of this writing, and is the syntax of choice for many wikis, blogs, forums and website generator applications. Markdown allows you to enter markup in an easy-to-remember manner, for instance using asterisks for emphasis (``**text to be emphasized**``) or pound-signs in front of headers (``### An H3 Header``), and it then takes care of the conversion to HTML markup in in the background.   \r\n\r\nWe are using the gh-pages branch as a CDN to store assets for the README.md.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
